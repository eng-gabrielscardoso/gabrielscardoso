# Architecture

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the architecture for our project. This architecture is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and secure, leveraging modern development practices and tools.

## Components

### Laravel Framework

Laravel serves as the core framework, providing a robust MVC structure, routing, Eloquent ORM, and a variety of utilities and services that streamline web development.

### Docker

Docker is used to containerise the application, ensuring consistency across development, staging, and production environments. It allows for easier dependency management and isolation.

### Livewire

Livewire is a full-stack framework for Laravel that makes building dynamic interfaces simple, without leaving the comfort of Laravel. It handles server-side rendering and provides reactivity in the frontend.

### FilamentPHP

FilamentPHP is used for creating complex administrative interfaces. It provides tools for building admin panels with ease, leveraging Laravelâ€™s capabilities and simplifying backend management.

### Pest

Pest is a testing framework for PHP that provides a streamlined, user-friendly syntax. It is used for unit and integration testing to ensure code quality and reliability.

### DaisyUI + TailwindCSS

Component library for TailwindCSS. While Tailwind CSS provides utility classes for each CSS rule, daisyUI provides additional component class names to Tailwind CSS to make it faster and easier to build web pages. The project uses these two libraries together to build fancy and simple UI components.

### AWS Services
